# Design Write-up

To match the "glassmorphism" aesthetic, the calculator rests on a background gradient that shifts from a pale ice blue to a muted navy in light mode, and a deep teal blend in dark mode. The main calculator container uses rounded corners, semi-transparent surfaces, soft drop shadows, and a blur filter to create the impression of frosted glass floating above the background. Buttons borrow from the same palette, using higher opacity for primary operations and softer tints for utility controls so that the hierarchy of actions is clear at a glance.

Functionally, the layout keeps the running total and the previous equation visible at all times. The main readout uses a monospace-inspired typeface for consistent character spacing, and the history label fades slightly so the current input always has visual priority. The light/dark toggle is duplicated as both a switch and a Mode button to ensure it can be accessed via mouse, keyboard, or touch. Every interaction feeds through a single controller that guards against duplicate decimals, empty deletes, or incomplete equations, keeping the experience predictable regardless of the order in which buttons are pressed.
