# Design Write-up

The calculator now embraces a neumorphic aesthetic that feels soft and sculpted whether you arrive in dark or light mode. A midnight-to-slate gradient eases into a solid, midnight-blue shell by default, casting paired shadows so the surface appears gently raised. Light mode flips the palette to powdery whites with the same dual-shadow treatment, keeping depth cues consistent across themes. Buttons, the display well, and other interactive regions reuse the theme colors but sit within their own subtle highlights and lowlights so the hierarchy of actions remains obvious without harsh contrast.

Interaction feedback was tuned to support the tactile story: every key is wrapped in material ink so taps release a bold ripple, while the Mode switch continues to mirror the dedicated Mode button for quick toggling. The controller logic still centralizes every calculator action, preserving the guardrails around decimals, deletes, and chained operations. Launching directly into the dark theme showcases the refined shadow work, yet the interface remains legible thanks to balanced text colors pulled from the adaptive Material color scheme.
