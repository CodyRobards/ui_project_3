# Snazzy Calculator

A Flutter-powered calculator with glassmorphism styling, a dark/light mode toggle, and complete arithmetic functionality. The project satisfies the requirements outlined in `Calculator.md` and `Grading_Rubric.md`.

## Features
- Full set of calculator buttons (digits, decimal, operations, equals, clear, delete).
- Live history readout showing the active formula.
- Responsive display that prevents duplicate decimal points.
- Dedicated buttons and switch to toggle between coordinated light and dark themes.
- Glassmorphism-inspired layout with gradients, blur, and frosted surfaces.

## Getting Started
1. Install the latest [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and ensure the Dart extension is enabled in VS Code.
2. Open this folder (`ui_project_3`) in VS Code.
3. Press **F5** (or select **Run > Start Debugging**) to launch the app using the included `.vscode/launch.json` configuration.

You can also run the project from the terminal:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
